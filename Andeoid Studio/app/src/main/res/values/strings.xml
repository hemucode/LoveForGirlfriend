I will always love you, and I promise that you will find strength and happiness in our relationship.</string>
    <string name="letter25">My adorable darling, Until I met you, I had no idea that life could be full of happiness. There are so many new things and feelings that I have experienced with you.

    <string name="letter34">Love, I was convinced that love is blind because someone as gorgeous as you fell in love with someone like me. But whatever be the case, I feel that I am truly fortunate that you have accepted my love. Thank you</string>
    <string name="letter35">Honey, I want to look into your eyes when we walk together, but I am scared to tumble. I want you by my side, but then I might not be able to look at your face. Therefore, I choose to sit down and enjoy this life with you, looking into your eyes and kissing you without any distractions.</string>
    <string name="letter36">Darling, I want to tell you that you are my first thought in the morning and my last thought before I fall asleep. No minute passes by when I do not sigh, wanting to be near you, with you. I know you are out there chasing your dreams, and I am here trying to make a life of my own. However, I cannot help missing you badly. You are a part of everything I do because I hold you close to my heart.</string>
    <string name="letter37">My Dearest Love Today, I was at the supermarket when a couple in front of me stood holding hands. I immediately thought of you and the warmth you shared with me whenever it got chilly during the winter months. The packet of ramen on the shelf reminded me of the annoying slurping sound you make while eating. I almost bought a beer box when I realized that the one who drinks it all isnâ€™t waiting at home. Everything around me reminds me of you. No matter where I look or what I do, you are always with me. I miss you every moment of every single day.</string>
    <string name="letter38">Dear (Nickname) Waking up alone is the worst thing ever. I feel as though the days without you have been stretching so long. Itâ€™s almost unbearable. But know this, my love, I am proud of what you are doing, and you always have my full support. I miss you like crazy, but I find solace because you are happy doing what you love doing the most. You are where you always wanted to be, and I am truly happy for you. All I wish for is to meet you soon to make up for all the time we missed being together. I hope to see you soon!</string>
    <string name="letter39">Hi Honey, Even though we are miles away from each other, I feel the deep bond we share each time I think of you. I miss your wet kisses and warm hugs. I miss the way you act funny, just to make me laugh. I miss the way we talk about anything and everything under the sun. And I miss the way you bite your upper lip when you are up to some mischief. But I know we both have to be strong if we want to make our dreams come true. And I hope weâ€™ll soon be together, never to be separated again. Love you, my darling.</string>
    <string name="letter40">Hi Babe, If absence makes the heart grow fonder, then I think I hold all the â€˜fondnessâ€™ in the world for you. Each day spent without you feels like years. I know we promised to stay strong, but sometimes I cannot help wishing you were here to hold me and tell me that everything will be alright. Watching Netflix alone is no fun, and even my favorite fried chicken feels tasteless without you. I miss you from the bottom of my heart and yearn for the day Iâ€™d see you again.</string>
    <string name="letter41">Dear (Nickname) It has been exactly 286 days, 13 hours, and 15 minutes since you left the city, which means I have to brave it out another 250 days till I can finally have you in my arms. Whenever I miss you, I hug your Lakersâ€™ jersey and try to sleep, hoping to see you in my dreams. I hope you are happy in your new place. Do not worry about me, as your love is enough for me to get through these days of physical separation. Though I miss you terribly, I want you to know that I am there with you and would like you to come back to me only after you have completed the task you set out to achieve. All the best, my dear. See you soon.</string>
    <string name="letter42">Hey (Nickname) You are my sun and my moon that light up my world. You are the ketchup to my fries and the guacamole to my nachos. You are the Noah to my Allie and Harry to my Sally. You are the William to my Kate. You are the iOS to my Apple and Windows to my Dell. You are the tint to my lipstick and glimmer to my gloss. You are my everything. Love you lots!</string>
    <string name="letter43">Dear (Name) We bicker and fight when we are together, and now that you are away, I feel so lonely without you. I now realize how much I love you. I remember how youâ€™d start laughing in the middle of a fight or buy me ice cream to make up with me or hug me in bed to tell me you still love me. Your gentle touch, your sweet voice, and your sweet scent still linger on and keep me going. I wish I could make you come back sooner. I love you, baby. I always will.</string>
    <string name="letter44">My Dear, I hope you are well. Iâ€™m writing to you to tell you that I pledge my heart to you. I promise to give this relationship my all and make it work despite the distance. I think of you each day, my love. I now see how incomplete my life feels without you, and Iâ€™m glad that our time apart has cleared my mind of any doubts. I want you to know that I wish the best for you no matter where you are. I hope to meet you and hug you soon. Love</string>
    <string name="letter45">Dear (Name) I have never been able to say this when you were here, but this distance between us has pushed me to pour my heart to you. I want you to know that despite being surrounded by loneliness, the only thing that keeps me sane is your love. It is very easy to feel bogged down by adversities, but I keep afloat because your love consumes my entirety. With you, in my life, there is nothing that I cannot overcome. You bring so much positivity in my life that negativity does not even look in my direction. I never said this before but know that you are the love of my life, and I hope to spend an eternity with you.</string>
    <string name="letter46">My Love, All my worries seemed insignificant from the time I fell in love with you. It feels like your love is the ultimate solution to everything. When Iâ€™m happy, I think of you. When Iâ€™m lonely, I think of you. Even when Iâ€™m angry, I think of you, and everything seems to dissipate as your love takes over. I feel Iâ€™m the luckiest girl in the world to have a wonderful man like you in my life. You are the most amazing person I know, and my strength to face this distance comes from you. I cannot wait to drown you in my love. See you soon.</string>
    <string name="letter47">Sweetheart, You will be happy to know I fixed the garage shelf today. I know I should not be bragging about it, but I feel like an achiever. Well, thanks to you, you have transformed me, and I love this version of myself. Falling in love with you has made me see my true self. And I wish for nothing but the best for you. Continue working hard, and one day, all your dreams will come true. You deserve all the happiness in the world, and I hope I can make you happy too. And no matter where you are, remember that I will always love you.</string>
    <string name="letter48">Honey Hereâ€™s another letter to remind you that I love you and I am thinking about you. I love the way you look at me; it makes me feel beautiful and precious. I love the way you kiss me. I love your geeky nature; it assures me that you will always have a solution to all my silly problems. I love your handsome face; it makes my heart race. And finally, I love you making me feel special every day, every second. You are the most special person in my life, and I can never stop loving you. Love you loads.</string>
    <string name="letter49">Dear (Nickname) I wish you could feel my heartbeat whenever you smile. I wish you could see the twinkle in my eyes whenever you are around. I wish you could sense my skin tingle under your warm touch. I wish you could feel my love for you despite this distance between us. Yes, I love you more than you can imagine, and I know we are just meant to be. I love you</string>
    <string name="letter50">Love , When I think about us, I wonder if we can keep going, with this distance between us. I then remember the wonderful times we spent together, and I cannot be more sure that we are simply perfect together. You may annoy me by blowing air bubbles in your glass like a little kid, but you also put me to sleep on days when I am feeling down. You never remember to take out the trash, but you always get my favorite cake for my birthday. There is absolutely no doubt that I love you. I love you and accept you with your flaws and strengths. Hugs and kisses</string>
